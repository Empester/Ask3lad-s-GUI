### Ask3lad's Statement from His Discord Regarding the Test Drive GUI

> **Introducing the new War Thunder Test Drive GUI**  
> It has almost been a year since I released the War Thunder Test Drive and I've read your suggestions to make it easier and more simple. The last few months I've been working on an **Ask3lad Test Drive GUI** to test drive any vehicle **within SECONDS...**  
> No more changing IDs within the files — when new vehicles come out, they can be easily added with an update to the tank database.  
> Additionally, I've updated the test drive map to 3.0, based on the War Thunder Hangar, to include:
> - New helicopter targets  
> - Aircraft respawns  
> - A new "D Point" Active Protection testing zone  
> - And many more features
