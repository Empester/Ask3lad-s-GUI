Ask3lad's statement from his Discord Regarding the Test Drive GUI:

**Introducing the new War Thunder Test Drive GUI**
It has almost been a year since I released the War Thunder Test Drive and I've read your suggestions to make it easier and more simple. The last few months I've been working on an **Ask3lad Test Drive GUI** to test drive any vehicle **within SECONDS...** No more changing IDs within the files and when new vehicles come out it can be easily added with an update to the tank database. Additionally I've also updated the test drive map to 3.0 based on the War Thunder Hangar to include new helicopter targets and aircraft respawns, new "D Point" Active Protection testing tone and many more features.
